# Stroke-Prediction

Created a prediction ML model to provide the likelihood that someone could get a stroke. The goal is so that people can prevent it in the future whether that be adjusting their lifestyle. The model was trained off of the stroke prediction dataset and I tested several models. Specifically Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees.
